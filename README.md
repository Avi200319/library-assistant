# library-assistant
A library assistant that works with python and a mysql database made back in 12th grade

Uses tkinter and mysqlconnector to go through a library database to allow for the easy issue and return of books.

Login system and quick search features that can easily be modified and expanded.

In hindsight, way too much effort for a 12th grade project.
